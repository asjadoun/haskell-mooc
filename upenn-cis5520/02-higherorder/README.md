# Material about higher-order functions in Haskell



Code to accompany first lectures & in-class exercises for CIS 5520. 

The description of these modules and in-class exercises will be posted on the
[CIS 5520
website](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/schedule.html). Most of
this code will not make sense without these descriptions.
